The wolf pack is one of nature's most sophisticated social orders, it is usually a family group of five to eight animals, consisting of a pair of breeding adults and their young of 1 or 2 years old. It feeds on large prey like bison, elk, deer, beaver, pronghorn, and anything else it can catch.</p>
