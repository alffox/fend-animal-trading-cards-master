			<p class="description">The Rocky Mountain wolf inhabits parts of the western United States, western Canada, and Alaska, including Unimak Island of the Aleutians, and is the sub-species that was reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho in 1995-96. The wolf pack is one of nature's most sophisticated social orders, it is usually a family group of five to eight animals, consisting of a pair of breeding adults and their young of 1 or 2 years old. The Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf feeds on large prey like bison, elk, deer, beaver, pronghorn, and anything else it can catch.</p>
